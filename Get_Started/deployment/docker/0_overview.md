# Docker Overview

**Docker** is a containerization platform that helps you run your apps in isolated environments. In AI Agent development, Docker simplifies deployment and makes your environments consistent — whether you're running locally or on the cloud.

This section will help you understand:
- Why Docker is important for AI agent systems
- How Docker fits into Flowise and other frameworks
- Basic Docker terms you should know before jumping in

## 🧠 Why Use Docker in AI Agent Development?

- **Consistency**: No more “it works on my machine” issues.
- **Portability**: Package your agent as a Docker image and deploy it anywhere (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
- **Scaling**: Use Docker with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to scale your AI agents.
- **Rapid Testing**: Spin up new test environments in seconds.
